# BitquestCode
Capstone project done my senior year of College. Will only include code that I do.

Current Version Details:
Code worked for what was required, but needs some work in areas.  Example save/loading is client side.  Combat is not any where near perfect, due to no real animations or AI for the bots mostly.

Current Update:
05/03/2016 Just upload at the end of the semester.

Future Plans:
Orginaze the file structure.
Update some of the files with things we as a group wanted to do, but could not get to.

Past Updates:
none
